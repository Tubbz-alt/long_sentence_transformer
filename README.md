# Long sentences Transformer to Document Ranking

This repository store all codes used to make experiments with LongFormer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) and Reformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) in the document ranking task as final project for
Deep Learning applied to NLP course in UNICAMP 1st-2020.

# The Reformer


# The LongFormer


# The MS MARCO dataset

We used the MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset available in https://github.com/microsoft/TREC-2019-Deep-Learning that contains full documents and search queries. There is an annotated file that relate an relevant document to a specific query that we use to generate our positive-relation query-document, and another document that is the top-100 documents related to a specific query generated by BM25 simple baseline that we will use as a negative-relation query-document (or "unjudged document").

To use all files as train dataset we need to make "tripletes" with files in the format: 

query_string | positive_document_string | negative_document_string

For this task i use GCP with the $300 free trial. All process made and how to use GCP can be found in []().
